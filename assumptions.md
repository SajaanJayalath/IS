## Current Status Update (16/08/2025 - 1:56 PM)

### **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Model Predict Methods
**Problem**: Model classes were missing predict() methods causing "object has no attribute 'predict'" errors
**Solution**: Added predict() methods to all model classes (CNN, SVM, Random Forest)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - All models now working correctly

### **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Model Path Resolution
**Problem**: GUI and segmentation modules looking for models in wrong directory (models/ vs src/models/)
**Solution**: Updated all model loading paths to use correct src/models/ directory
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Models loading successfully in GUI

### **CURRENT ISSUE**: GUI Segmentation Not Detecting Hand-Drawn Digits
**Problem**: User drew a "5" on canvas but segmentation returns "No digits found in image"
**Symptoms**: 
- GUI loads successfully with all models
- Drawing canvas works and shows drawn digit
- Image preview displays correctly
- But segmentation fails to detect any digits
- "Compare All Models" shows empty results for all models

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Segmentation filtering parameters too strict for hand-drawn digits
- Canvas drawing may need different preprocessing approach
- Contour detection parameters need adjustment for GUI canvas images

**Next Steps**:
1. Adjust segmentation filtering parameters (min_area, aspect_ratio thresholds)
2. Improve canvas image preprocessing for better segmentation
3. Add debugging output to segmentation process
4. Test with both canvas drawings and uploaded images

### **Implementation Status**:
- ✅ All core components implemented (Days 1-7)
- ✅ Models trained and working (CNN: 99.45%, SVM: 96.31%, RF: 95.19%)
- ✅ GUI application functional with all features
- ✅ Model loading and prediction methods fixed
- 🔄 **CURRENT**: Fixing segmentation sensitivity for hand-drawn digits
- ⏳ **NEXT**: Final system validation and testing

### **Technical Debt**:
- Segmentation parameters need tuning for real-world images
- Canvas drawing preprocessing may need optimization
- Error handling could be more robust in GUI
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
